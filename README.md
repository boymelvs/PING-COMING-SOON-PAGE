## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## Overview

This is a solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  Submit their email address using an `input` field
-  Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
   -  The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
   -  The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_
